(Existing) Right now, suspected COVID patients or COVID+ patients are quarantined at home.
(Existing) Providers lose visibility into patients once they are discharged and rely on phone calls for periodic checkins.
(Development)Build a remote patient monitoring for patients who have symptoms and need to be homemonitored,patients who tested positive and have been discharged home, or have comorbid conditions that require closer monitoring. 
(Additional Requirement) Potential for partnering with medical device companies that create digital thermometers or pulse oximeters.
==================================================================================
Existing:
1. A citizen come to hospital for covid19 test.
2. He/she found positive in test.
3. Four cases are possible:
	a. He/she is treated in the hospital.
	b. He/she need to be home-monitered: Called by Doctor periodically
	c. He/she is discharged home: Called by Doctor periodically
	d. He/she requires close monitoring because of comorbid condition: Called by Doctor periodically/

=================================================================================
Solution:
1. Create a centralized database for COVID19 patient if found positive.
2. Update whether he/she has comorbid condition, as well as the severity in his/her case.
3. Update whenever he get's discharged.
4. Create a global database for the doctors who are treating the case for covid19 patient.
5. Create a web page for hospitals to add the details of COVID19+ patients.
6. (Additional) Create the push notifications for hospitals whenever patient ask for emergency.
7. Create a location tab which allows the track patient location using patient ID.
8. (Additional) Create map that shows location wise patients.
9. Update the frequency for which the patient need to be checkins.
10. Create an Android Application and install it in the patient smartphone.
11. Patient should be logged using his/her patient ID.
12. At a time on the day based on the frequecy set by the hospital the patient should be asked about the any problems with the given option: 1. Given Symptoms or 2. No Problems.
13. If patient doesn't respond in 5 minutes by using his/her fingerprint or face along with selected choice.
14. Alert would be sent to the doctor who treated the patient telling he is not well.
15. Apart from frequency checks, if patient feels an emergent in medical condition there is emergency button that patient can press. The alert would sent globally to all doctor as a request 
to treat the patient and any doctor could treat the patient.
16. If doctor accepts the request he will be connected to the video stream with patient directly.
17. Android Application for Doctor's perspective will contain the list of patient whom he treated.
18. On clicking the patient from list they will show the graph which tells the patient cure progress.
==================================================================================================
Technical Implementation for each Step:
1. Create a centralized database for COVID19 patient if found positive.
2. Update whether he/she has comorbid condition, as well as the severity in his/her case.
3. Update whenever he get's discharged.
9. Update the frequency for which the patient need to be checkins.
	a. Create an SQL based database table on 000webhost.com
	b. The field will be 
			 patient_id (VARCHAR(50), PRIMARY_KEY), 
			 patient_name (TEXT,100),
			 age(NUMBER(3)),
			 contact_number(NUMBER(10)),
			 admitted_date (TIMESTAMP),
			 hospital (TEXT,200),
			 severity (VARCHAR,10),
			 home_latitude(FLOAT),
			 home_longitude(FLOAT),
			 current_latitude(FLOAT),
			 current_longitude(FLOAT),
			 has_breathe (BOOLEAN),
			 has_fever (BOOLEAN),
			 has_cough (BOOLEAN),
			 has_blueface_or_lips (BOOLEAN),
			 is_comorbid (BOOLEAN),
			 diseases (TEXT(400)),
			 discharge_date (TIMESTAMP),
			 frequency_checkin(NUMBER(10))
			 image_of_patient (URL,100)
	c. Writing pHp files for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
		- connect.php (Database Connection).
		- create.php (Insert the query to table).
		- read.php (Read a row in table).
		- update.php (Update a row in table if found).
		- delete.php (Delete a row in table if found).
		- image_upload.php(Upload image with patient_id.jpg to folder '/patients/')
		- server.php (Create a Websocket server for location monitor).
		- push.php (Create a Web Push Server to send push notifications on website
			using https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php ).
	d. Initially make the database and pHp files in XAMPP. 
	e. Test the pHp API files with POSTMAN.
	f. If CRUD operations are performed correctly. Deploy it to 000webhost.com

4. Create a global database for the doctors who are treating the case for covid19 patient.

					doctor_id (VARCHAR, PRIMARY_KEY),
					doctor_name (TEXT),
					hospital (TEXT),
					mobile(NUMBER(10)),
					email(VARCHAR(50)),
					is_engaged(BOOLEAN)
					image_doctor(URL,100)
			c. Writing pHp files for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
					- connect.php (Database Connection).
